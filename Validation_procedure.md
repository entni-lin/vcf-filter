# Validation of VCF Filtering Tool Correctness
To ensure that the code logic is sound and works as expected, the following tests and manual inspections could be performed:
1. **Generate Additional Test Datasets and Prepare Specificed JSON Criteria Files :** Create a variety of VCF input files that cover different cases and typical use cases. For example, generate sample VCF files containing:
   - Variants that clearly meet all criteria (*e.g.,* with high TLOD and DP values).
   - Variants that fail one or more criteria (*e.g.,* borderline values, missing fields, etc.).
   - Records with multiple allelic sites to ensure that at least one of the values passing the filtering criteria is correctly recognized. 
2. **Perform Unit Testing:** Use  `pytest` to write unit tests for core functions such as `evaluate_condition` and `variant_passes`. These tests can simulate different input scenarios and compare the output of the functions to expected results. This approach helps isolate and verify small pieces of logic within the code. To install `pytest`, run the following:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
3. **Compare Testing to the Expected Outputs:** If there is a pre-validated expected output file (*e.g.,* data/expected_output.vcf), one can automate the verification by comparing the generated output with this file using the `diff` command:
```bash
diff data/output.vcf data/expected_output.vcf
```
- No differences indicate that the code produces the expected results.
